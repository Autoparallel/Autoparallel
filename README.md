### Welcome!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [Arbiter](https://github.com/primitivefinance/arbiter).
- ðŸ”­ Side projects: 
  - Combinatorial topological techniques in DeFi. 
  - Perhaps looking into projects like [this](https://github.com/Lichtso/geometric_algebra/).
- ðŸ“– I am reading:

In the past I studied mathematics and physics. Now, I'm more interested in computing and distributed systems as well as mechanism design. There's a wonderful interplay between math and computing that I started to love over the years. I would really enjoy getting to apply the background I have in pure mathematics to formal verification of software. Quantum computing is another subject high on my list of interests (and would be fun to explore deeper given my background in Clifford algebras).

Currently a Senior Researcher at [Primitive](https://github.com/primitivefinance)
