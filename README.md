### Welcome!
You can find my personal site here: [autoparallel.xyz](https://autoparallel.xyz).
All opinions shared there are my own and do not reflect any views from any organizations I am associated with whatsoever.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on [ronkathon](https://github.com/pluto/ronkathon).
- 📖 I am reading:
  - [x] The Three Body Problem Series
  - [ ] [Real World Cryptography](https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-cryptography)
  - [ ] [Proofs, Arguments, and Zero-Knowledge](https://people.cs.georgetown.edu/jthaler/ProofsArgsAndZK.html)

In the past I studied mathematics and physics. Now, I'm more interested in computing and distributed systems as well as cryptography. 
There's a wonderful interplay between math and computing that I started to love over the years. 
I would really enjoy getting to apply the background I have in pure mathematics to formal verification of software. 
Quantum computing is another subject high on my list of interests (and would be fun to explore deeper given my background in Clifford algebras).

Currently a Staff Research Engineer at [Pluto](https://github.com/pluto)
