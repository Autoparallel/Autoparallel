### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [Arbiter](https://github.com/primitivefinance/arbiter)
- ðŸ”­ Side projects: Ethereum nodes
- ðŸ“– I am reading [Atomic Habits]([https://www.amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788/ref=sr_1_1?crid=BD92KKAWTTD3&keywords=hooked+book+nir+eyal&sprefix=hooked+book+nir%2Caps%2C191&sr=8-1](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-James-Clear-audiobook/dp/B07RFSSYBH/ref=sr_1_1?gclid=CjwKCAiAv9ucBhBXEiwA6N8nYE0XOb4sp8UveSF580IxLNtdIlZRCIcxyVvWYeaY9pngMsGdZoMh9xoCr9QQAvD_BwE&hvadid=390244329573&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9028896&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=17220615911703307944&hvtargid=kwd-679783660480&hydadcr=19140_10195819&keywords=atomic+habits+an+easy&qid=1670873960&sr=8-1)).

In the past I studied mathematics and physics. Now, I'm more interested in computing and distributed systems with application in blockchain. There's a wonderful interplay between math and computing that I started to love over the years. I would really enjoy getting to apply the background I have in pure mathematics to formal verification of software. 

Currently a Senior Researcher at [Primitive](https://github.com/primitivefinance)

*I think that having free time to just be a human is super important.*
