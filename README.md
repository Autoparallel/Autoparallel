### About Me

I am a mathematician and physicist turned research engineer, currently serving as Co-Founder & CTO at [**Multifactor**](https://multifactor.com).

My core design philosophy is to build beautiful math and beautiful software: systems that are **provable, modular, extensible, and composable**. I believe the rigor of first-principles thinking is the foundation for creating robust, secure, and impactful technology. This approach applies whether I'm working on applied cryptography, distributed systems, or agent-based simulation.

### Current Focus: Multifactor

At Multifactor, we are redefining zero-trust for the modern web by leveraging post-quantum cryptography to bring mathematically-provable security to complex applications.

### Open Source Projects

On the side, I lead mathematics-based software development with [**Harness Labs**](https://github.com/harnesslabs).

* [**Arbiter**](https://github.com/harnesslabs/arbiter): A multi-agent framework for the design, simulation, and auditing of complex systems.
* [**Cova**](https://github.com/harnesslabs/cova): A library for making abstract mathematics computational.
* [**Ronkathon**](https://github.com/pluto/ronkathon): A project for learning and implementing cryptographic primitives from first principles.

### Background & Education

* **Previously:** Staff Research Engineer at **Pluto** & **Primitive**.
* **Ph.D. in Mathematics** from Colorado State University.
